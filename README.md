# KNN-Julia
First steps with Julia Repository where I implement a KNN classifier in Julia.

# Introduction

Julia is like this relatively new language for Data Science and Machine Learning and I wanted to try it out to see how difficult it is to implement a (relatively) simple Machine Learning algorithm in the language.

# Dataset

The dataset being used is the [Chars74k Dataset](https://ee.surrey.ac.uk/CVSSP/demos/chars74k/).

# Setup Instructions

*as of right now, the project is kinda, incomplete so expect this section to be updated once I get done with that*

 ### Packages Used
 * Images
 * DataFrames
 * IJulia
